            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Disclaimer</h2>

            <ul class="px-3">
              <li>an electronic or physical signature of the owner (or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the copyrighted work;</li>

            </ul>

            <p>If You believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against You, You may send us a counter-notice. If You do, we will notify the alleged claimant and hold process for 10-14 days and then re-enable Your content unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action against You before then. Our counter-notice form, set forth below, may be referenced to the forms recommended by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website: <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/" target="_blank" class="text-body-primary">www.copyright.gov</a>.

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Indemnity</h2>
            <p>YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, CONTENT PROVIDERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND CONTRACTORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") HARMLESS FROM ANY BREACH OF THESE TERMS OF USE BY YOU, INCLUDING ANY USE OF THE SERVICES OR CONTENT OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN THESE TERMS OF USE. YOU AGREE THAT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH BREACH OR UNAUTHORIZED USE, AND YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY ANY AND ALL RESULTING LOSS, DAMAGES, JUDGMENTS, AWARDS, COSTS, EXPENSES, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. YOU WILL ALSO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ACCESSED FROM THIS PLATFORM.</p>

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Governing Law</h2>
            <p>The use of the Service and these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflicts of law rules. You acknowledge that Your use of the Service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws that may apply in addition to these Terms.</p>

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Disputes Resolution</h2>
            <p>Any claim, dispute, or controversy of any kind or nature arising hereunder which cannot be amicably resolved by the Company and You shall be solely and finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its commercial arbitration rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall take place before a panel of one arbitrator sitting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrators will be bound to adjudicate all disputes in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. The decision of the arbitrator shall be in writing with written findings of fact and shall be final and binding on the parties. With respect to any arbitration hereunder, You hereby expressly waive any right to consolidate any claim and/or participate in any class-action claim of any kind or nature. This Section provides Your sole recourse for the settlement of any disputes arising out of, in connection with, or related to these Terms. If any provision of this clause is found unenforceable, such unenforceable provision will be removed and the remaining terms will be enforced. For the avoidance of doubt, You are agreeing to give up: (i) Your right to litigate any claims that may arise hereunder in court or before a jury; and (ii) Your right to consolidate any claim and/or participate in any class-action claim that may arise hereunder in any manner or forum.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, You may elect to pursue a claim in small-claims court rather than submit to binding arbitration, but only if You provide us with written notice of Your desire to do so within 30 days after Your first use of the Services. Any small-claims court proceeding initiated hereunder will be limited solely to Your individual dispute; i.e., You are not permitted to file, or participate in, a class action suit in small-claims court with respect to these Terms.</p>

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, the unenforceable or invalid provision shall be modified to reflect the intent of the original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law. The remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Waiver</h2>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions will remain in effect. We reserve the right to waive any provision of these Terms and Conditions at any time, but such waiver shall only be effective if made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Company.</p>

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between You and Us regarding the use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between You and Us relating to the Service.</p>

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">No Partnership</h2>
            <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between You and Company as a result of these Terms or use of Company's Services.</p>

            <h2 class="h5 fw-bold">Modification</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms and Conditions at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
